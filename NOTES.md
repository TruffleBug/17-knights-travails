- breadth first traversal 

- create function to generate adjacency list for a certain vertice
- create function to traverse adjacency list for next closest vertice
    - function should skip any vertice that has already been visited
    <!-- - function should choose new vertice with average of x & y closer to average of endpoint x & y  -->
